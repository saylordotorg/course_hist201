**Unit 1: The Middle Ages** <span id="1"></span> 
*By the tenth century, Germanic monarchs had established and
consolidated kingdoms across Europe.  The Catholic Church also extended
its power during this period; church reforms and the threat of Islamic
expansion renewed the Church’s authority in European politics and
society.  The Crusades—a series of religious wars launched by the Holy
Roman Empire to restore Christian control of the Holy Land—which began
in 1096, were the most conspicuous sign of the rise and expansion of
Christian Europe.*  
  
 *But by the fourteenth century, warfare, the arrival of the bubonic
plague, and conflicts within the Catholic Church laid the foundation for
the eventual collapse of medieval society.  In this unit, we will see
how the consolidated power of the Church and various monarchies during
the High Middle Ages gave way to deep religious and political divisions
within Europe by 1300.*
