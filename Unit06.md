**Unit 6: Absolutism and Constitutionalism in Western Europe** <span
id="6"></span> 
*In the wake of the religious wars of the seventeenth century, monarchs
in western Europe attempted to consolidate and increase their power.
 Many sought to fashion themselves as “absolute” monarchs—sole leaders
whose power exceeded that of the people, the government, and/or the
Church.  However, these efforts were met with varied results.  In
France, Louis XIV (known as the “Sun King”) successfully established
himself as an absolutist ruler.  But the Netherlands, on the other hand,
expulsed Catholic absolutist Spain in 1572 and created a Dutch Republic
that supported religious toleration and republican government.  In
England, a constitutional crisis centered on the question of whether
sovereignty was vested in the king or Parliament resulted in the
beheading of Charles I, a civil war, and the Glorious Revolution of
1688.*  
 *     
 In this unit, we will examine why absolutism was successfully
implemented in France and why it was challenged or defeated in the Dutch
Republic and in England.*

     The first reading will give you a sense of the socio-economic
    landscape of the newly created Dutch Republic.  George Edmundson’s
    “Chapter VI” discusses the political, religious, and military
    turmoil from which an independent Dutch Republic emerged.    
        
     The Act of Abjuration, signed into law in 1581, formally declared
    the Dutch Low Countries independent of Phillip II of Spain.  The
    Dutch had endured religious persecution, war and the tyrannical rule
    of Catholic Spain before they finally rebelled.  The Dutch
    Declaration of Independence (1581) asserts the Dutch’s people’s
    right to secede from an oppressive monarchy; it later inspired the
    American Declaration of Independence.
