*The Renaissance paved the way for the emergence of a rational and
secular worldview in Europe in the late 1600s.  The Scientific
Revolution and the Enlightenment represented the culmination of the
shift from the medieval era to the modern world.  Scientific
revolutionaries overturned the authority of medieval and classical
sources, such as Aristotle and Ptolemy, in an attempt to understand and
explain man in the natural world according to mathematical reasoning.
 For example, the Polish astronomer Nicholas Copernicus asserted that we
live in a heliocentric cosmos and Isaac Newton proposed a set of
universal laws and claimed that we live in a mechanical universe (a
cosmos governed by the same mathematical laws of gravity on Earth).
 Meanwhile, political philosophers of the Enlightenment emphasized
reason as the primary source of legitimacy and authority.  Studies
examining the origin of political authority and the progress of society
had a fundamental impact upon the political development of Europe.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study how and why “enlightenment” manifested
itself throughout Europe—in philosophy, science, art, and even in
absolutist monarchies.*
