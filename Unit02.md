**Unit 2: Renaissance** <span id="2"></span> 
*In Italy during the late Middle Ages, the contours of a new cultural
movement—the Renaissance—began to emerge in urban centers such as Rome,
Venice, Florence, and Milan.  Meaning “rebirth” in French, “the
Renaissance” refers to a revival of classical Greek and Roman sources,
an emphasis on realism in art, and educational reform.  Renaissance
thinkers emphasized humanism—a moral philosophy that considers humans to
be of primary importance—in art, philosophy, politics, science, and
religion.  This new interest in humanism represented a drastic shift
away from the focus on the divine that had dominated medieval European
thought for centuries.  By the sixteenth century, Renaissance culture
had spread to other regions of Europe.*  
 *     
 In this unit, we will study the profound impact that Renaissance ideas
had on European society, religion, and politics.  We will also compare
and contrast the Italian Renaissance with Renaissances in other parts of
Europe.*

    Petrarchan sonnet—a 14-line poem about unattainable love with a set
    rhyme scheme of abba abba cdc dcd.  In this text, Petrarch writes
    about his unrequited love for a woman known only as “Laura.”

     This political treatise was written by Niccolò Machiavelli, a
    Florentine political theorist, in the sixteenth century.  In an era
    of constant conflict among Italian city-states, Machiavelli asserts
    that the greatest moral good is a virtuous and stable state.  Even
    if actions taken to preserve the state are immoral, Machiavelli
    argues, they remain justified.  The text, with its “end justifies
    the means” pragmatism, had a deep impact on Western philosophy.
