****This course will introduce you to the history of Europe from the
medieval period to the Age of Revolutions in the eighteenth century.
 You will learn about the major political, economic, and social changes
that took place in Europe during this 800-year period.  The course will
be structured chronologically.  Each unit will include representative
primary-source documents that illustrate important overarching
political, economic, and social themes, such as the Renaissance, the
Protestant Reformation, European expansion overseas, and the French
Revolution.  By the end of the course, you will understand how Europe
had transformed from a fragmented and volatile network of medieval
polities into a series of independent nation-states by 1800.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  
  

-   Think critically and analytically about European history in the
    medieval and early modern eras.
-   Identify and describe the religious, intellectual, social, and
    political components of the European Middle Ages.

    European Renaissance, as well as describe new developments in art,
    philosophy, religion, architecture, and science during the era of
    “rebirth.”

    Discovery.  Students will also be able to analyze the impact of
    overseas expansion on European monarchies, the world economy, and

    able to identify the origins of the movement, the various
    inflections of the Reformation across Europe, and the Catholic
    Counter Reformation.

    Protestant Reformation.  Students will analyze causes and effects of
    the religious conflicts that erupted in France, England, the
    Netherlands, and the Holy Roman Empire.
-   Identify and explain why and how “absolute” monarchs gained power in
    western Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  Students
    will also be able to identify and describe why two nations—England
    and the Netherlands—embraced constitutionalism rather than
    absolutism.
-   Assess how and why absolutism characterized the monarchies of
    Prussia and Austria in the 1600s.  Students will also be able to

    to assess the origin and impact of the “agricultural revolution,”
    the marked increase in Europe’s population, the development of
    “cottage industries,” the rise of the Atlantic economy, and the
    changes in domestic and religious practices.
-   Identify and describe the origins and impact of the French
    Revolution.  Students will also be able to analyze the rise of

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
After working through each unit of the course, students must take the
Final Exam.  Note that you will only receive an official grade on your
final exam.  However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you
will need to work through the materials for each unit.

In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on
the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

**Time Commitment:**This course will take you about **90.25 hours** to
complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the amount of
time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These should help you
plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a look at these
time advisories and to determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for yourself. 
For example, Unit 1 should take you 9 hours.  Perhaps you can sit down
with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a total of 3
hours) over the course of Monday through Wednesday; subunit 1.2
onThursday; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions: **Pay careful attention to major names and events in
each reading and/or lecture.  Taking detailed notes as you work through
the materials in each unit and remembering these terms will help you
prepare for the Final Exam.
