**Unit 9: Social and Economic Change in the Eighteenth Century** <span
id="9"></span> 
*The end of the bubonic plague and the absence of devastating wars
opened the door to significant changes in society and economy during the
1700s.  Population growth skyrocketed and created an unprecedented
demand for food.  This in turn spurred an agricultural revolution in
which land was improved and transformed into viable farmland.
 Meanwhile, the rise of the cottage industry—the production of goods in
the home rather than in the factory—fueled the growth of manufacturing
and urbanization.  At the same time, European nations created an
Atlantic economy that centered upon the African slave trade, New World
plantation produce, and European textiles and manufactured goods.*  
  
 *In addition, many changes were wrought in the domestic sphere.  New
developments in the structure of European society and economy in the
eighteenth century had a significant impact upon marriage, family,
medicine, nutrition, and religious beliefs.  With the rise of
manufacturing, many European women began to work, and this altered
patterns of marriage and childbearing.  Improved diet and better
medicine translated into a longer lifespan for many Europeans.  Also, as
nation-states became increasingly consolidated throughout Europe, the
“vernacular”—the regional or national language or dialect—was
increasingly emphasized in schools and churches.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will consider how and why European population growth,
agricultural transformations, new developments in manufacturing, and the
rise of an Atlantic economy were so interconnected.  We will also see
how manufacturing and the agricultural revolution influenced Europeans’
daily lives and belief systems.*

    Smith” for some background.  Then, read Washington State University
    and the Modern History Sourcebook’s excerpts from the Wealth of
    Nations.   
        
     Perhaps the most influential book of the eighteenth century, Adam
    Smith’s *Wealth of Nations,* sharply criticizes the
    mercantilism—protective trade policies—that European imperial powers
    had embraced for over a century.  Smith, a Scottish moral
    philosopher, advocates free trade as the most progressive and
    beneficial commercial policy of the modern era.  In the first
    excerpt, he argues that if capital is allowed to travel freely,
    rather than being controlled by government or state-supported
    monopolies, then it will naturally travel to the most productive
    outlets; Smith calls this phenomenon the “invisible hand” of a free
    market economy.  In the second excerpt, Smith describes how modern
    capitalism should work ideally and why this is good for society
    overall.
