**Unit 7: Absolutism in Eastern Europe** <span id="7"></span> 
*The Thirty Years’ War left Central and Eastern Europe far less
economically advanced than their counterparts in western Europe.  In the
wake of the war, monarchs in Prussia, Austria, and Russia attempted to
centralize their authority and strengthen their respective states.  The
Austrian Habsburgs recognized the weaknesses of the Holy Roman Empire
and began to consolidate their power outside of Germany.  In Russia,
Peter the Great attempted to implement political reform, forge alliances
with Western Europe, and deflect attacks from the powerful Ottoman
Empire.  In addition, serfdom revived in Eastern Europe, giving rulers
more power over land and peasants.  *  
  
 *In this unit, we will see how absolutist rule in Prussia, Austria, and
Russia united fragmented kingdoms and safeguarded them against internal
division and foreign invasion.*
