**Unit 4: The Era of Reformation** <span id="4"></span> 
*The Protestant Reformation began in 1517, when a little-known German
priest, Martin Luther, nailed his ninety-five theses protesting the sale
of indulgences—the full or partial remission of punishment for sins—to a
church door.  The weaknesses of the Catholic Church during the late
Middle Ages, including corrupt popes, schisms, and unresolved doctrinal
issues, made Europeans receptive to Luther’s protests and calls for
reform.  Although the Reformation began in Germany, it spread throughout
Europe during the sixteenth century.  Protestant reformers, such as John
Calvin, substituted their own scriptural beliefs for those held in Rome.
 The Catholic Church, however, launched a powerful Counter-Reformation
by calling a major church council at Trent and by encouraging the
formation of new Catholic religious orders.  *  
  
 *In this unit, we will see how the religious upheaval of the
Reformation caused fundamental changes in European society, including
religious life, marriage, education, and the status of women.*
