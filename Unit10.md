**Unit 10: The Age of Revolutions, 1775-1815** <span id="10"></span> 
*The Enlightenment’s emphasis on political legitimacy and authority—as
well as the perceived corruption of absolute monarchs—inspired several
revolutions in the latter eighteenth century.  In France and in America,
many citizens began to question why the majority of a nation’s people
were denied equal rights or liberty.  In 1776 and 1789, respectively,
the Americans and French revolted against the tyrannical and
illegitimate authority of aristocrats in order to protect the sovereign
rule of the people.  In America, patriots replaced the British monarchy
with a confederated republic.  In France, revolutionaries abolished the
constitutional monarchy in favor of a new republic.  However, the French
republic was short-lived—Napoleon proclaimed himself dictator of France
in 1799.*  
 *     
 In this unit, we will examine the emerging contest between the rule of
the people and the rule of a few in the Euro-American world.  This
contest manifested itself in two different but related revolutions that
had a lasting impact upon Europe.*

     The French Revolution began in May 1789 with the meeting of the
    Estates-General—a general assembly representing the three French
    estates of the realm: the nobility, the church, and the common
    people.  Summoned by King Louis XVI to propose solutions to his
    government’s financial problems, the Estates-General sat for several
    weeks in May and June 1789 but came to an impasse as the three
    estates clashed over their respective powers.  It was brought to an
    end when many members of the Third Estate formed themselves into a
    National Assembly, signaling the outbreak of the Revolution.  On
    July 14 of that same year, the Bastille—amedieval fortress and
    prison which represented royal authority in the center of Paris—was
    stormed by a mob that demanded the arms and ammunition stored
    there.

    a French statesman and friend of Thomas Jefferson.  The document,
    inspired by Enlightenment ideals, defines a single set of individual
    and collective rights for all men.  In advocating universal equality
    and freedom, this treatise also calls for the destruction of the
    aristocracy in France.

    Paine’s radicalism.    
      
     The second reading linked here, *Reflections,* written by the
    British conservative MP Edmund Burke, is one of the most famous
    political treatises in European history.  Burke offers a sharp
    critique of the French Revolution—for its violence and its abolition
    of the monarchy and aristocratic institutions.  Burke fears that the
    radicalism of the French conflict constitutes a withdrawal from the
    European state system and a rejection of history.  In contrast,
    Burke supports the American Revolution, because it does not involve
    the execution of a king, senseless bloodshed, or the destruction of
    long-standing political institutions.

     The French invasion of Russia in 1812 was a turning point in the
    Napoleonic Wars.  It reduced the French invasion forces to a tiny
    fraction of their initial strength and triggered a major shift in
    European politics as it dramatically weakened French hegemony in
    Europe.  As a result, the reputation of Napoleon as an undefeated
    military genius was severely shaken.
