**Unit 5: The Age of Religious Wars, 1546-1648** <span id="5"></span> 
*From Martin Luther’s death in 1546 to the middle of the seventeenth
century, religiously- and politically-inspired violence dominated
Europe.  France endured nearly fifty years of civil war and
strife—mainly due to conflicts between Calvinists and Catholics.
 Catholic Spain struggled against Protestant England and the
Netherlands.  The Thirty Years’ War, a conflict between Catholics and
Protestants within the Holy Roman Empire, devastated central Europe.  In
this unit, we will see how the religious conflicts unleashed by the
Reformation caused war, devastation, and political divisions throughout
Europe.*

     Instructions: Please read Dr. Kreis’s entire lecture linked above.
     Then, read both “Chapter XXX” and “Chapter XIX” of Montaigne’s
    *Essays* linked above.  
        
     Dr. Kreis’s lecture discusses how European philosophers and
    thinkers, such as René Descartes, John Locke, and Thomas Hobbes
    began to view man’s role in the world differently as a result of
    European religious conflicts and exploration abroad.    
        
     Montaigne examines the world through the lens of his own judgment
    in this series of essays, a literary genre that he popularized in
    the sixteenth century.  His goal in these essays is to describe
    man—and himself— with utter frankness.  “Of the Caniballes” will
    give you a sense of how overseas exploration influenced Montaigne’s
    criticism of European society, while “Liberty of Conscience” will
    give you a sense of how the French religious wars influenced
    Montaigne’s view of Christianity.  In Montaigne’s *Essays,* the
    French writer Michel de Montaigne adopts a skeptical tone when
    depicting Renaissance society.
