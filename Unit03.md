**Unit 3: The European Age of Discovery** <span id="3"></span> 
*The Renaissance set the stage for European state consolidation and
expansion overseas between 1450 and 1650.  In the fifteenth century,
powerful monarchs launched the first stage of global imperialism.  New
developments in maritime technology and a desire to expand the influence
of Christianity motivated European rulers to sponsor exploration and
conquest in the New World.  In this unit, we will see how the creation
of new commercial and political networks caused profound change: they
introduced new peoples, ideas, and cultures to Europeans, while also
wreaking havoc on indigenous cultures of the New World.*
